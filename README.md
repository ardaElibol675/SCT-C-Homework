# Solar Car Team C++ Homework

> In this homework, I have examined usage of C++, and created some projects with it.

### C++ Fundamentals
**In this part, I have practised on C++ fundamentals:**
I have worked with different varibales, investigated their types, sizes and behaviours, pointers, memeory allocation, basic data structures and STL containers.

### Calculator
**Firstly, I have programmed a calculator:**
I have implemented class structure in "Claculator.h" and function definition in "Calculator.cpp" into calculator app. From "main.cpp", the calculator can be used via it's menu.

### Point Structure
**Then, I have programmed a point structure:**
I have created a point structure, getting 2 points from the user in 3D space and making a couple of operations with the points.

### Robot Dead Reckoning Simulator
**Finally, I have programmed a robot dead reckoning simulator:**
I have created a robot dead reckoning simulator. The robot object starts at the origin and the user can perform some operations from the menu like moving, rotating etc.
